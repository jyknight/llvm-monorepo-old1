This directory contains builtins from AMD's OpenCL builtin library.
There is an ongoing effort to port these builtins to libclc.  If you
would like to port a function, review the libclc-dev@pcc.me.uk archives
to make sure no one is already working on it.  If no one else has started
this port, then send an email to libclc-dev@pcc.me.uk with the subject

Porting: builtin_name

This way we don't have multiple people trying to port the same functions.
