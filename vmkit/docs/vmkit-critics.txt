VMKit implementation critics:
=============================
* strictfp Java keyword not implemented.
* No verification of Java class bytecode. This is a requirement for any JVM, except CLDC and Card profiles.
* POSIX-dependent. Could use BoostC++ for OS portability.
* Manipulation of C++ object virtual table, which is compiler-specific and architecture-specific and is not standard.
  VMKit implementation supposes vtable pointer is placed in offset zero of the object, which is not true among all
  versions of G++ (sometimes it is placed last).
  Moreover, multiple inheritence produces multiple vtable pointers in one derived object. VMKit supposes the existence
  of a single vtable.
* Reinventing the wheel in some situations. Use BoostC++. e.g. Lock classes.
