<p>This document is a "TODO" list for HLVM.  Each project in this document is 
something that would be useful for HLVM to have, and would also be a great way 
to get familiar with the system.  Some of these projects are small and 
self-contained, which may be implemented in a couple of days. Others are 
larger.  In any case, we welcome all contributions.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about tackling one of these projects, please send a mail
to the <a href="/hlvm-dev.shtml">HLVM Developer's</a> mailing list, so that we 
know the project is being worked on.  Additionally this is a good way to get 
more information about a specific project or to suggest other projects to add 
to this page.</p>

    <li><em>RNG->XHTML XSLT Stylesheet</em>. We will use the Relax/NG grammar
    for the XML version of the AST to document the AST. However, the Relax/NG
    specification is not particularly user friendly. What we need is a way to
    publish (in XHTML) the specification with descriptive documentation. A
    fairly straightforward XSLT stylsheet to translate Relax/NG to XHTML should
    do nicely. This is a nice self-contained project for someone who knows
    XSLT and can understand Relax/NG.</li>
    <li><em>Test Cases</em>. In order to explore and test the AST node
    construction and code generation, we need to develop test cases that
    exercise these aspects of HLVM. Test cases currently come in two flavors:
    <ul>
      <li><b>xml2xml</b>. These are snippets of XML to test construction of the
      AST by using the hlvm-xml2xml program. Many of these test cases will
      explore ideas for what should or shouldn't be in the AST.</li>
      <li><b>return0</b>. Thse are full HLVM programs written in the AST XML
      language that should return from main with a value of 0 if the test
      succeeds. They are intended to check control flow, arithmetic, and other
      aspects of runtime behavior of the HLVM code generator and runtime system.
      </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><em>APR Abstractions</em>. The runtime portion of HLVM will use APR
    as its portability layer. However, APR is written in C and not particularly
    object-oriented. We need some of the things APR supports to be wrapped in
    simple C++ classes that take care of the book keeping such as deleting APR
    objects at the right time.  Abstracts we need to wrap, currently, are Pool
    and File. These should go in HLVM's "base" library.</li>
    <li><em>Code Generation</em>. If you know or would like to learn LLVM,
    we could use help with conversion of HLVM's AST into LLVM's IR. </li>
    <li><em>API Documentation</em>. Documenting the HLVM AST API is very
    important. Currently it needs some work. Someone who knows Doxygen and 
    would like to keep the documentation up to date would be very helpful.</li>
    <li><em>Yaml Reader/Writer</em>. We intend to support a reader and
    writer of the AST in Yaml syntax. Some people just don't like XML and having
    an alternate way to build the AST from a nicer-to-read source would be
    useful in helping some people comprehend HLVM. The design should be very
    similar to the XML Reader/Writer and be based on the Syck library.</li>
  </ol>
