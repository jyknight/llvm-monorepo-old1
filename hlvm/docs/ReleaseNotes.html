  <p>Welcome to the High Level Virtual Machine (HLVM). This document contains 
  the release notes for HLVM. Here we describe what's new, what changed, what
  platforms are supported, known problems, and installation notes.</p>
  <p>This document can be updated as things are discovered after the software 
  is released. If you are reading this from the release files, you should go
  to the <a href="http://hlvm.org/releases/">HLVM Releases Site</a>
  to read the most recent version. If you are reading this from the SVN sources,
  the release notes apply to the <i>next</i> release of HLVM, not the most
  recent release.</p>
  <p>For information on upcoming releases and future plans, please refer to the
  <a href="http://hlvm.org/Plans.shtml">HLVM Release Plans</a> page.
  <p>For more information on HLVM, please visit the main

<div class="text">
  <p>This is the first public release of the High Level Virtual Machine. This is
  a very early pre-release, version 0.1. That is, HLVM is not complete yet and
  it doesn't do very much.  The main goal for this release was to get HLVM to
  run the "Hello, World" program, which it does.  However, completing that goal
  means that two things are in place: (1) the build system and (2) the basic
  architecture of the project.</p>
  <p>This release is probably only of interest to the HLVM developers and those
  who are just crazily interested in virtual machine technology. This software
  is being released early because of our release policy which follows Linus
  Torvald's philosophy: Release Early, Release Often.  Essentially, we define 
  feature sets for upcoming releases in small increments. When those features 
  are completed we release it to the public. This requires the developers to
  quickly cycle through the entire software development life cycle and ensures
  that HLVM never gets too far off course or loses quality.</p>
  <h2><a name="features">New Features In HLVM 0.1</a></h2>
  <p>Since this is the first release of HLVM, <i>everything</i> in HLVM is new!
  However, here are the main things accomplished in this release:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Build System</em>. A build system based on 
    <a href="http://www.scons.org">scons</a> was implemented and currently
    handles building the software, running the test suite, generating the
    documentation, participating in code generation, compiling the runtime with
    LLVM, and installing the final product.</li>
    <li><em>Basic Architecture</em>. We have defined several libraries for HLVM:
    <ul>
      <li><b>AST</b>. This library provides the implementation of the Abstract
      Syntax Tree which is the heart of the HLVM implementation. These classes
      form a multi-way tree that is used as the representation of the user's
      program.</li>
      <li><b>Base</b>. This library provides common utilities shared across all
      of HLVM.</li>
      <li><b>Reader</b>. This library will contain readers to translate a
      variety of on-disk format into the in-memory AST nodes. Currently there 
      is only an implemented reader for XML.</li>
      <li><b>Writer</b>. This library will contain writers to translate from the
      in-memory AST nodes to a variety of on-disk formats. Currently there is
      only an implemented writer for XML. This library complements the Reader
      library and the two libraries should be synchronized in the formats they
      read and write.</li>
      <li><b>Pass</b>. This library provides a mechanism for making a
      <i>pass</i> over the AST nodes and various pass implementations.
      Currently, only a rudimentary verification pass has been implemented. In
      the future this library will contain optimization passes and other
      AST-&gt;AST passes.</li>
      <li><b>CodeGen</b>. This library provides code generation passes. This is
      a separate library because none of thse passes produce AST nodes. Instead,
      they translate the AST into some other form, from which translation back
      to AST is not possible. Currently a rudimentary code generator for 
      <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is provided. In the future there may
      be other code generators for generating XHTML documentation, C code, 
      etc.</li>
      <li><b>Runtime</b>. This library provides the HLVM runtime. This is the
      component of HLVM that is linked with the user's program to provide
      services to it. Currently, the HLVM runtime provides a few functions for
      handling output and command line arguments so that the "Hello, World"
      program could be implmented.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><em>Tools</em>. HLVM has a set of executable tools built from the 
    libraries that HLVM provides. Currently, the tool set includes:
    <ul>
      <li><b>hlvm</b>. This tool provides an implementation of the HLVM Runtime
      as a stand alone executable. Currently it doesn't do much but tell you its
      version and provide help with options</li>
      <li><b>hlvm-xml2xml</b>. This tool converts HLVM XML input into the AST
      tree nodes and then back out to HLVM XML again. This is used mainly as a
      test driver to ensure construction and pass management is working in HLVM
      without invoking other parts of the sytsem.</li>
      <li><b>hlvm-compiler</b>. This tool converts HLVM XML into LLVM bytecode 
      or LLVM assembly code. In the future it may be able to compile HLVM into 
      any of the other forms that HLVM supports as well as create stand-alone
      programs.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li><em>Test Suite</em>. HLVM provides a test suite that uses Deja-Gnu to
    automate the tests. Currently the test suite provides two kinds of tests.
    The <tt>xml2xml</tt> test suite uses the <tt>hlvm-xml2xml</tt> tool to
    validate that HLVM can generate its input to its output. These are
    fundamental tests that ensure the stability of the AST.</li> The
    <tt>return0</tt> test suite uses the <tt>hlvm-compiler</tt> to generate an
    executable program from XML source, execute it, and assert that the program
    returns 0. Right now there's only a few programs in this category but there
    will be many more in the future.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><a name="changes">Significant Changes in HLVM 0.1</a></h2>
  <p>There have been no changes since the last release.</p>
  <h2><a name="platforms">Platform Support</a></h2>
  <p>HLVM is known to work on the following platforms:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>x86 machines running Linux (FC3, FC5, SuSE)</li>
    <li>PPC machines running Mac OS/X (10.4 Tiger)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>HLVM probably runs on many other operating systems and hardware but the
  developers have not yet tried them. If you are successful in bulding HLVM on
  another platform, <i>please let us know!</i></p>

  <p>The main known problem with this release is that there isn't enough of HLVM
  implemented to be useful in any significant way.</p>
