<div class="text">
<p>Welcome to HLVM! This document shows you how to get started with the High
Level Virtual Machine. Before you do that, lets get some questions answered up
front to make sure you actually want to get started with HLVM.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>What is HLVM?</dt>
  <dd>HLVM is a toolkit for building virtual machines for dynamic languages. Its
  not something everyone is going to want to mess with. Generally, it is highly
  technical and doesn't really do much for an end user. On the other hand, if
  you're developing your own dynamic programming language, HLVM is <em>just</em>
  the ticket.</dd>
  <dt>Who uses HLVM?</dt>
  <dd>Generally, programming language researchers and software tool vendors 
  use HLVM.</dd>
  <dt>What does HLVM do?</dt>
  <dd>HLVM doesn't really <em>do</em> anything. While it provides a few
  executables, these are ancillary in nature. Most of HLVM's capabilities are
  provided through a set of code libraries that can be incorporated into other
  programs. HLVM does provide a virtual machine executable but without a program
  to run (one that has been compiled by HLVM based tools), the virtual machine
  won't do anything. So, if you're an end user of software, HLVM probably isn't
  for you. If you're a developer, however, we think you'll find HLVM quite
  spiffy.</dd>
  <dt>How hard is HLVM to build?</dt>
  <dd>Although we've tried to make building HLVM dead simple, it is a
  complicated system and you must understand some of those complexities to get
  it right. One of its major complexities is that it incorporates many other
  packages that are not distributed with HLVM. You must build and install those
  packages yourself.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Okay, if you're still interested in HLVM, then we have a few more
introductory things to cover:</p>
<ol>
  <li>HLVM provides a suite of libraries and a few tools. These are statically
  linked (archive files and object files) so that you can incorporate the
  appropriate pieces into your project. This was done purposefully since we
  don't believe that creating a monolithic shared library (DLL) is particularly
  useful. This architecture gives you the freedom to construct your own
  libraries by picking the appropriate things from the palette that HLVM offers.
  </li>
  <li>Although HLVM provides several tools, these are ancillary in nature. They
  are provided to help either with testing HLVM or to help you use HLVM. The
  <tt>hlvm</tt> program (the actual virtual machine) is a reference
  implementation. You may choose to implement it differently (with the help of
  HLVM's runtime libraries, of course).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<div class="section"><a name="overview"><b>Overview</b></a></div>
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<p>HLVM is dependent on a number of other software packages. These
packages will be required before you can build HLVM. Fortunately, the configure
script will tell you which packages you lack. The table below shows the software
that HLVM depends on. You <b>must</b> obtain and build these packages yourself
if they are not already present on your system.</p>

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
<div class="section"><a name="requirements"><b>Requirements</b></a></div>

<div class="text">

<p>Before you begin to use the HLVM system, review the requirements given below.
This may save you some trouble by knowing ahead of time what hardware and
software you will need.</p>

  <p>Compiling HLVM requires that you have several software packages installed. 
  The table below lists those required packages. The Package column is the usual
  name for the software package that HLVM depends on. The Version column 
  provides "known to work" versions of the package. The Notes column describes 
  how HLVM uses the package and provides other details.</p>

<div class="text">
  <h2>Separate Install Area</h2>
  <p>It is suggested that you keep a separate installation area for building the
  things that HLVM depends upon. This is the location in your file system where
  you will install the built packages. It is used with the <tt>--prefix</tt>
  option to the configure programs of the packages. By using a separate install
  area, you ensure that the HLVM version of required packages doesn't interfere
  with any of your system installed packages.</p>
  <h2>libxml2</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Always build libxml2 first. It doesn't depend on much else</li>
    <li>Use version 2.6.24 or later</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>apr</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Optionally use the <tt>--enable-debug</tt> configure flag.</li>
    <li>Required to use the <tt>--enable-threads</tt> configure flag.</li>
    <li>Required to use the <tt>--enable-other-child</tt> configure flag.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>apr-util</h2>
  <p>No special instructions.</p>
  <h2>llvm</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You <em>must</em> use the latest CVS version of LLVM. LLVM is HLVM's 
    sister project and the two are intricately connected. Consequently, patches
    are made to LLVM in order to satisfy HLVM's requirements. At some point,
    this restriction will be lifted as a released version of LLVM will contain
    all of HLVM's requirements. However, while in development you should
    checkout the latest version of LLVM and keep it up to date.</li>
    <li>Configure LLVM with --prefix=/path/to/install/llvm</li>
    <li>Build LLVM with "make tools-only". You don't need the runtime library
    because we will be using llvm-gcc4</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>llvm-gcc</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You <em>must</em> use version for of llvm-gcc, not version 3.</li>
    <li>Obtain llvm-gcc4 source from 
    <a href="http://nondot.org/sabre/2006-06-01-llvm-gcc-4.tar.gz">
      http://nondot.org/sabre/2006-06-01-llvm-gcc-4.tar.gz</a></li>
    <li>Alternatively, you can obtain a binary version of llvm-gcc4 for
    Linux (Fedora Core 3) from
    <a href="http://llvm.org/2006-06-01-llvm-gcc4-linux-x86-binary.tar.gz">
      http://llvm.org/2006-06-01-llvm-gcc4-linux-x86-binary.tar.gz</a></li>
    <li>You <em>must</em> install llvm-gcc4 into an installation area that
    is not used by any other software, particularly gcc. This is required
    because you might clobber your compiler's runtime libraries and tools
    otherwise.</li>
    <li>See the <tt>README.llvm</tt> in the top of the llvm-gcc4 source bundel
    if you're inclined to build llvm-gcc4 on your own. It isn't hard but there
    are a few things you need to do correctly.</li>
